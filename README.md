# Team Manager
* The program is a Java program that prompts the user to log in as either an manager or a member. It accomplishes this by creating a command-line interface where the user is presented with a menu to choose their option. The user is required to enter a valid option, which is then processed, and if the option is invalid, the corresponding login process is invoked.
* The program has two interfaces: one for the manager and the other for members. The manager is able to view members and assign tasks. The manager can assign a maximum of five tasks. 
* The members are only allowed to view members and tasks.
Overall, the program serves as a basic example of how to implement a login system in Java.
